I"€<p>Hello. today we will see another very basic and profound integral part of machine learning and statistics, Bayes filter. It mainly derived from bayes rule and itsâ€™ basic objective is to find out the likelihood/estimation of current state given all the actions and observations up to now. 
\(p(x_t|z_{1:t}, u_{1:t})\)
Usually, state estimation is called belief, so we introduce new term :
\(bel(x_t) = p(x_t|z_{1:t}, u_{1:t})\)</p>

<p>We will apply Bayes rule to simplify this term as it is almost impossible to directly obtain current state from actions and observations up to now.</p>

$$ P(A|B)= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} $$
