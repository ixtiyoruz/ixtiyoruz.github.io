<h1> Bayes Rule </h1>
<p>
Hello. In todays post we will go through one of the most important topic in machinle learning and mathematics which is Bayes rule. We will see its derivation mainly using some math so before reading make sure you have some knowledge about probability theorem.

Initially lets assume that we have two kinds of data available ( we will learn the Bayes rule using  basic robot module):
1. z sensor information (observation)
2. u actions.
